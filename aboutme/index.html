    <p>Hello everyone, I am glad to be here. I am Nigerian and live in Enugu, a city majorly known for high avaliablity of
         coal as a natural resource.
        I am the first child of my parents and have four other siblings. 
        I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for over 10 years and counting, served a mission from
        2018 -2020 here in Nigeria.</p>
    <p>Recently, I decided to continue my education through pathway and will be having Applied Technology for a degree in due time. 
        Not married yet, but that is one of my long term goals along getting my degree, and web development as one of my certificates. </p>
    <p>I am indeed grateful  to the leaders of the church for creating BUY-Pathway as an opportunity to improve lives. I see the world we live in being controlled by
         technology innovatively and I dream to be part of those professionals who will be leading in any sector when the time comes. </p>
    <p>I am a professional when it comes to few interior designs which includes epoxy floors, ceilng stretch, along with floor and wall murals. 
        I enjoy playing PC video games such as COD, Far Cry and PES.
